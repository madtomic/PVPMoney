# PvPMoney by charries96
# Simple plugin to give money for killing other players
# Originally developed for my home server, but realised the potential given other similar plugins are broken
# 
# Variables:
#   %killer%    is automatically replaced with the name of the killer
#   %victim%    is automatically replaced with the name of the victim
#   %currency%  is automatically replaced with whatever your currency symbol is
#   %amount%    is automatically replaced with how much money the killer gets
#   Giving the users the "pvpmoney.extras" node will give them the amount under ranked instead.
