# PvPMoney by charries96
# Simple plugin to give money for killing other players
# Originally developed for my home server, but realised the potential given other similar plugins are broken

#   %victim%    is automatically replaced with the name of the victim
#   %currency%  is automatically replaced with whatever your currency symbol is
